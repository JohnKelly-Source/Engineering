<p>A big part of this project is How much it will cost how much effort will be put into installing it and how much time it will take. 
    <ul>
    <li>The fiberglass cost $1.48 a piece and is 6x6 so that means with a 20 dollar budget we can get 13 tiles. </li>
    <li>The tiles are square edged meaning they are very easy to cut so if we would have to make any adjustments on them it wouldn't be a problem. </li>
    <li>Time wise the delivery time would be about 7-8 days and pickup would be 10 days. </li>
    <li>The installation would be on the easier side because the tiles have tracks on the back that connects to wires and stays on the ceiling</li>
    </ul>
