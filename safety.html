      <p>This design will not require permanent alterations to the space because they are drop down ceilings
    Fiberglass is environmentally friendly.
    A gridwork of metal channels suspended on wires from the overhead structure. Each cell is then filled with panels
    dropped ceiling is a pathway for HVAC airflow, acting as an air plenum for the hot air return. this air movement can combine with the other material above the ceiling to create a fire hazard. Therefore the ceiling needs to be cleaned.
    breathing airborne dust containing fiberglass may irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. This will only be a issue for the person cutting the fiberglass in that case they can wear safety material. This can also be a issue if the fiberglass is made from cheap material.
